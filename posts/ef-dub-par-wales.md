After a couple of awesome years working in marketing, then the engineering department at Education First, I was able to go on my first staff which spent a couple days in each of Dublin, Wales, London and Paris.  We tagged along a couple of high school groups, who ended up being incredibly fun and hilarious travel partners.  All-in-all a 10/10 time.

### The Highlights

We met our tour guide, Camilles, as well as the high school groups ranging from different parts of the US, in the airport in Dublin.  Then it was off to the races, visiting the famous statue of Oscar Wilde and the Trinity College library.

In the same sense that L.L. Bean seems to fund half of Maine, Guiness was a huge provider for the city of Dublin.  Naturally, I had to make a pit stop at their factory to learn the perfect pour.

We did not spend a ton of time in Wales, mostly bussing through, but we managed a few castles and beautiful countryside villages along the way.

I honestly do not remember what we did in London, but I do remember getting this awesome meat pie.  And fish and chips.

![Paint](/images/posts/dublin-wales-paris/paint.jpg '[paint]')
Oh yeah, we did go to a Warhammer pop up shop where this dude taught us how to paint miniatures and play Warhammer.

I have actually been lucky enough to be able to visit Versailles a couple of times in my life.  It has been just as incredible each time (and just as busy).

This particular trip I found it super fun to try and spot all of the 'Space Invader' street art along Paris.  There was a lot, as well as a handful of other really neat street art pieces all around the city.
