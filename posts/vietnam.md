2014 trip to meet my friend Hai Nguyen's family in Vietnam.  At the time, I was blogging for his cashew import business where he was importing his family's roasted cashews.  We decided to make a trip over to see the process and get some cool pictures. 

### The Highlights

Hanging out in the streets of Ho Chi Minh (Saigon) for the first time.

Ca Phe Sua Da - nector of the gods.  One of my favorite culinary/drinking experiences in the world is drinking a fresh Vietnamese iced coffee after walking around a humid city for a bit.

Trains, busses and rice paddie fields as we traveled throughout the country side.  That bus was one of the worst travel experiences of all time... cramped, hot 4+ hours with no openable windows.
