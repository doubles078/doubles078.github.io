Over the past decade since college, I have joined or overheard numerous discussions on are what the best tools for note taking and task organization. Time and time again, it really came down to, everyone has a different preference of how and what to organize in their daily schedules. Some like it simple, some like a lot of visuals, some like a tech-less journal approach. Personally, right after I graduated, I created a Google sheet dubbed 'The Master List' and have been using it ever since. It has evolved significantly over those years and continues to be adjusted.

## How to use the Master List

- Every morning, after breakfast and â˜•, adjust the daily to dos
- Have your yearly goals (or life goals) written in so you see them daily
- Have a backlog of items for the month
- Create tabs for pretty much anything that you want to keep for a long time

## Tab Ideas

My most useful ever-present tabs are my '30 Ideas', 'YouTube Cookbook', 'Parent Loan Tracker' and 'Gift Ideas'. 30 Ideas is a brainstorm of side project ideas I come up with. I'll drop them into that tab then clean them up every once in a while to keep it to a solid 30. YouTube Cookbook is really just a compilation of great recipes ðŸ¥˜ that I have found online and want to try again. Parent Loan Tracker is an accounting tab for a personal loan I am paying back. Lastly, Gift Ideas is a list of my close family and friends, every time I see something that would be good candidate for a gift I note it down. This is incredibly useful when it gets around time for ðŸŽ‚ birthdays or ðŸŽ… Christmas.

## Note Taking Honorable Mentions

A lot of my friends LOVE the approaches below. My favorite I have tried alongside the Master List was the Bullet Journal approach.

- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/): Great for mobile and desktop note taking
