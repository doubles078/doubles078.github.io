Christine went to Bolivia for a month to practice her medical Spanish for the global health pathway at UMass Medical school.  We decided to meet up in Peru to explore before she came back to the US.  We went to many markets, chilled in mountain villages and hiked Machu Pichu.

### The Highlights

The markets were by far my favorite part (as they usually are). We went to many different markets, most consisting of the same things.  Alpaca sweaters, blankets and other textiles.

This is Alfred -- our mini alpaca fur alpaca.  We got him at one of the local Peruvian markets, then took him on a trip to the Carribean where he enjoyed sunbathing.
