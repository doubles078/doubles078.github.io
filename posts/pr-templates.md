One of my favorite little Marie-Kondo/Clean Cody tidbits I have really latched onto since joining [Robin](https://robinpowered.com/) is their use of [pull request templates in our Github repo](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository). All it is, is a little file name **pull_request_template.md** that goes inside a **.github** directory in your project. It really didn't take that long to get use to - and my PR descriptions went from maybe couple sentences (or just one...) of vague description - to generally well formatted lists, images, gifs and context on how to interpret and test the PR. Seems like an obvious addition to a project in hindisght, yet I still have not added one to this blog's repo... ðŸ¤¦
