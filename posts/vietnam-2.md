We had first trip to Vietnam, but what about second trip?  The cashew business was scaling nicely at this point and we had so much fun visiting the first time, that we found ourselves coming back 2 years later.

### The Highlights

First things first, explore a bit and get some Ca Phe Sua Da.

Eating and gambling with the family.  I learned all of my numbers in Vietnamese in order to play: mot, hai, ba, go!

Hai and I toured the Cu Chi tunnels.  They were horrifying.  We also got to shoot M1 Garands at the firing range ending the tour.

More hanging with friends and family.  Dinner with Khoe - very nice guy - and hiking with Hai's cousins.  We got caught in the craziest rainstorm I've ever been in while riding home on our scooters.
