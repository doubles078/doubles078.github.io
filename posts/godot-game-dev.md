After reading The Pragmatic Programmer, I was inspired to try to write some code outside of my normal realm of comfort (front end web apps). Being a gamer, like many many fellow programmers, I decided to try out some game development for the first time using the popular open source [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine.

\
It was so fun! ðŸŽˆ

\
A few of my key reflections and learnings were:

- Game development uses a lot more math than I am used to (gravity, movement, camera being a few of the big elements in question)

- Drawing pixel art and animations is very rewarding, even if they aren't that good ðŸ¤£. Here are a couple of sheets I made using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), with the anime Hellsing being the main inspiration.

- Godot is super cool. I was able to quickly pickup it's built in GDScript language and make a working game in honestly a very short amount of time (especially for a noob).

\
I have some ideas around the next game I want to make, but for now, I'll be focusing on a different upcoming project for 2024.
