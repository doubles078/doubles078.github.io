I have begun each of the past 6 years by creating a PowerPoint of goals I hope to accomplish for the following year. I use the end of December and early January as a time to reflect on what I set out to do the past year and what I am looking to grow in for the next. This year, in the name of simpifying and making my goals as transparent as possible, I am trying something new. I am going to track my progress in [my Master List](https://www.danvsworld.com/posts/organizing-life-with-google-sheets), and do my best to write concise monthly blog updates on my progress.

Historically, the most difficult challenge has been developing a consistent and productive morning routine - something I have always struggled with - so that will be the heart ‚ù§Ô∏è of what I will be trying to get into early this year. Here is to overcoming our mental barriers and kicking butt in 2022 ü•≥.
